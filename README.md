# AgenaRisk 10 Java API Example Android Studio Project

This example Android Studio project demonstrates how to get AgenaRisk 10 Java API running on an Android device.

# Usage
See [AgenaRisk 10 Java API](https://github.com/AgenaRisk/api) repository for more details on the API in general.

Note:
* AgenaRisk API is not thread-safe so make sure only one model is worked with at a time
* Power management and battery saver settings will slow down calculation dramatically, so it may be a good idea to warn your user or ask them to disable power management for your app

# Licensing
Please note a valid AgenaRisk license is required.
